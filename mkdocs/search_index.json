With its modular approach, comprehensive list of features and built from the ground up with a focus on speed and usability, this is the Unity camera plugin you need for your game. \nSee it in action!\n\n\n\nPro Camera 2D was nominated for the prestigious Unity Awards 2016 on the \"Asset Store\" category.\n\n\n \nIMPORTANT!\n \u2014 Pro Camera 2D and all extensions also work with perspective (3D) cameras and at any orientation (XY, XZ and YZ). This means Pro Camera 2D can be used not only for regular 2D games, but also for any 3D game with camera movement on a 2D plane.\n\n    \n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\nHow it works\n\n\n\n\nCORE\n\n\n\n\nThe core is where all the magic happens. It\u2019s as \nlight and optimised\n as possible and it basically takes care of knowing where things are and how to move there.\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n\n        \nCore\n\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\nEXTENSIONS\n\n\n\n\nExtensions bring the extra features that your camera may need by building on top of the Core, and you can combine them all for powerful and impactful solutions. Since they\u2019re not part of the Core, unused extensions have NO OVERHEAD on your performance. \nCurrently there are 19 extensions\n, but you can \neasily create your own\n using Pro Camera 2D\u2019s powerful architecture.\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n\n        \nCamera Window\n\n    \n\n    \n\n        \nCinematics\n\n    \n\n    \n\n        \nContent Fitter\n\n    \n\n    \n\n        \nForward Focus\n\n    \n\n  \n\n  \n\n    \n\n        \nGeometry Boundaries\n\n    \n\n    \n\n        \nLimit Distance\n\n    \n\n    \n\n        \nLimit Speed\n\n    \n\n    \n\n        \nNumeric Boundaries\n\n    \n\n  \n\n  \n\n    \n\n        \nPan And Zoom\n\n    \n\n    \n\n        \nParallax\n\n    \n\n    \n\n        \nPixel Perfect\n\n    \n\n    \n\n        \nPointer Influence\n\n    \n\n  \n\n  \n\n    \n\n        \nRails\n\n    \n\n    \n\n        \nRepeater\n\n    \n\n    \n\n        \nRooms\n\n    \n\n    \n\n        \nShake\n\n    \n\n  \n\n  \n\n    \n\n        \nSpeed Based Zoom\n\n    \n\n    \n\n        \nTransitions FX\n\n    \n\n    \n\n        \nZoom To Fit\n\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\nTRIGGERS\n\n\n\n\nThe triggers, like extensions, bring additional features for your camera. However, triggers live inside your game but outside the camera itself. They are objects on your game that when the camera reaches them it triggers some action. New \ncustom triggers are extremely easy to create\n as well!\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n\n        \nTrigger Boundaries\n\n    \n\n    \n\n        \nTrigger Influence\n\n    \n\n    \n\n        \nTrigger Rails\n\n    \n\n    \n\n        \nTrigger Zoom\n\n    \n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\nEasy to use\n\n\n\n\nPro Camera 2D was designed from the ground-up to be accessible to any game designer or developer. If you\u2019re just getting started you\u2019ll love the simplicity of our editor, but if you\u2019re an hardcore developer you can tweak, control and extend every aspect with the powerful API we built for you.\n\n\n\n\nOptimized\n\n\n\n\nBuilt with C# and always with performance as a top priority, Pro Camera 2D has a very small footprint that allows it to run smoothly on all supported Unity platforms including older mobile phones.\n\n\n\n\nModular\n\n\n\n\nAlthough Pro Camera 2D is crammed with features, not all of them will be useful for your game. But don't worry, with its unique modular approach you can precisely enable only what you need. Unused features have NO OVERHEAD on your game performance!\n\n\n\n\nBattle-tested\n\n\n\n\nPro Camera 2D is an essential tool for hundreds of Unity users, but more importantly, it's been used for released, and award-winning, games on multiple platforms. Check the \nShowcase\n for a few examples!\n\n\n\n\nExtensible\n\n\n\n\nIf there's something you see missing or if you have some specific need to your game, don't worry - you get full source code access, filled with useful comments, which you can easily extend to fit your specific needs! Creating an extension or trigger is super simple. \nSee how on the User Guide!\n\n\n\n\nFree Updates\n\n\n\n\nYour one-time purchase gives you lifetime access to all future updates (over 30 just in the past year!). Check the \nchangelog\n to see what\u2019s on the pipeline and if you have some requests or suggestions, \nget in touch\n!\n\n\n\n\nSupport\n\n\n\n\nReach out any time and you\u2019ll get a guaranteed response, usually within less than 24h.

            "text": "Core\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nThe Core represents the main class - \nProCamera2D.cs\n. It's a very simple class takes care of keeping track of all targets, knowing which axis to use (XY, XZ, YZ), how fast to move and, more importantly, it's the \nbrain\n of all extensions and triggers.\nHere are the main features of the Core:\n\n\nMulti-target follow (weighted)\n\n\n\n\nIf your game has multiple characters or if you just want to follow that special missile while still keeping your player in sight just add another target (or as many as you want) to the camera and you\u2019re done. ProCamera2D will find the average position of them taking in consideration their variable influences. Perfect for your Super Smash Bros. clone! \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow smoothness (per axis)\n\n\n\n\nSometimes you need your camera to be very fast on a certain axis and more fluid on another. Think platformers for example, you might want your camera to be less rigid when jumping. With ProCamera2D you can define the smoothness of the follow on each axis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPerspective \n Orthographic modes\n\n\n\n\nAll ProCamera2D features (except parallax and pixel-perfect) work exactly the same either with a perspective (3D) or an orthographic (2D) camera. No special configuration required. Simply change your projection type and you\u2019re done!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll axes support (XY, XZ, YZ)\n\n\n\n\nAre you building a platformer? A top-down racing game? A space simulator with a crazy camera setup? No worries, ProCamera2D has got you covered. With it\u2019s multi-axis support you can use it on any kind of 2D \n 2.5D game!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDolly Zoom\n\n\n\n\nAlso known as the Hitchcock effect, this method creates an amazing dramatic effect for the most intense moments on your game. Get creative!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSetup\n\n\nSelect your game camera (called Main Camera by default) and drag the component file to the Main Camera GameObject. You should now see the ProCamera2D component editor on the Inspector window when you select your Main Camera GameObject.\n\n\nEditor\n\n\nThis is how the ProCamera2D editor looks like. You can find it on your camera after adding the ProCamera2D component as explained above.\n\n\n\n\nDrop Targets Area\n\n\nAs you can probably guess, this area is where you can drag your camera targets to. By dropping them inside this box they will be automatically added to the targets list below.\n\n\n\n\nTargets List\n\n\nThis list shows you all the targets that the camera is currently following. You can re-order the targets (although it makes no difference), delete or duplicate a target.\n\n\nParameters\n:\n\n\n\n\nTransform\n: The Transform component of the target GameObject\n\n\nOffset\n: A horizontal and a vertical float that offsets the target position that the camera will follow\n\n\nInfluence\n (0 \u2013 1): A horizontal and a vertical float between 0 and 1 that defines how much influence each axis should have in the final camera position.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCenter Target On Start\n\n\nIf this checkbox is enabled the camera will instantly move to the targets position when the game starts. For this to work the target needs to be already added. \nFor centering targets added during runtime you should use the method \nReset\n.\n\n\n\n\nAxis\n\n\nChoose which axis your game uses. If it\u2019s a platformer you\u2019ll probably stick to XY, but if it\u2019s a top-down game you might be using XZ. Feel free to choose what fits you best. All features work exactly the same across all axes. Don\u2019t forget to rotate the camera accordingly.\n\n\n\n\nUpdate Type\n\n\nChoose when do you want the camera to update its position. Use FixedUpdate if your objects are moved using physics and stick to LateUpdate if you\u2019re moving them outside the physics loop. If you\u2019re using a mixture of both you\u2019ll have to test both types and see what works best for you.\nIf you want to use a custom timestep and need to manually update the camera movement, select ManualUpdate. This will require you to call the Move method on the core class and pass the desired timestep.\nRemember, if you\u2019re getting a stuttering camera movement is probably because you\u2019re using the wrong update type.\n\n\n\n\nOffset\n\n\nThis value adds an overall offset to the final camera position given by the targets and other influences. Use it to give a constant offset to the camera position. Remember that each target can also have it\u2019s own offset value.\n\n\n\n\nZoom With FOV\n\n\nThis option is only available when using a perspective camera. If enabled, the camera will zoom by changing the FOV instead of actually moving closer/further to/from the objects. Might look better on some cases, but on most it will cause some visual distortion above a certain threshold. Use with care.\n\n\n\n\nExtensions\n\n\nIn this section you control which extensions you want to have enabled for your camera. This section is here only as a quick way to add/remove components. You can still add/remove them manually like you would with any other component.\nSee the user-guide for more information on each extension.\n\n\n\n\nTriggers\n\n\nUse this section to add triggers and to navigate (on the scene view) to them. You can also see how many triggers of each type you have on the scene.\nSee the user-guide for more information on each trigger.\n\n\n\n\nMethods\n\n\nAlthough you can accomplish almost everything with the ProCamera2D editor, you might feel the need to have a more precise control or even change some parameters during runtime. For that, you start by importing the ProCamera2D namespace, by putting the following code on the top of your class:\n\n\nusing Com.LuisPedroFonseca.ProCamera2D;\n\n\n\n\nAfter that, all you have to do is access, from anywhere on your code, the ProCamera2D static instance. In the following example we add a camera target during runtime.\n\n\nProCamera2D.Instance.AddCameraTarget(myTransform);\n\n\n\n\nThrough the static ProCamera2D instance you can change any public parameter and access the methods described below.\nPlease notice that all extensions and triggers can also be accessed for runtime configuration but do not provide static instances, so you have to access them like you would any other standard Unity component.\n\n\n\n\nApply Influence\n\n\nThis method is used by most extensions. What it does is simply applying the given influence to the camera during one frame.\n\n\nApplyInfluence(Vector2 influence)\n\n\n\n\nParameters\n:\n\n\n\n\ninfluence\n: The vector representing the influence to be applied\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApply Influences Timed\n\n\nThis method is similar to the previous one but here you can pass an array of different influences and their respective durations.\n\n\nApplyInfluencesTimed(Vector2[] influences, float[] durations)\n\n\n\n\nParameters\n:\n\n\n\n\ninfluences\n: An array of Vector2\u2019s with the influences to be applied\n\n\ndurations\n: An array of float\u2019s with the duration of each corresponding influence\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd Camera Target\n\n\nSometimes you\u2019ll want to add some new camera targets during runtime. That\u2019s where this method comes in.\n\n\nAddCameraTarget(Transform targetTransform, float targetInfluenceH = 1f, float targetInfluenceV = 1f, float duration = 0f)\n\n\n\n\nParameters\n:\n\n\n\n\ntargetTransform\n: The transform component of the target\n\n\ntargetInfluenceH\n: The influence this target horizontal position should have when calculating the average position of all the targets\n\n\ntargetInfluenceV\n: The influence this target vertical position should have when calculating the average position of all the targets\n\n\nduration\n: The time it takes for this target to reach it\u2019s influence. Use it if you want a more progressive transition\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRemove Camera Target\n\n\nNot much to tell about this one. Use it to stop following a target.\n\n\nRemoveCameraTarget(Transform targetTransform, float duration = 0f)\n\n\n\n\nParameters\n:\n\n\n\n\ntargetTransform\n: The transform component of the target\n\n\nduration\n: The time it takes for this target to reach a zero influence. Use it if you want a more progressive transition\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet Camera Target\n\n\nGets the corresponding CameraTarget from an object\u2019s transform.\n\n\nGetCameraTarget(Transform targetTransform)\n\n\n\n\nParameters\n:\n\n\n\n\ntargetTransform\n: The transform component of the target\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdjust Camera Target Influence\n\n\nIf you want to adjust at runtime the influence that a target has you can use this method. Great to adjust a target influence based on its distance or speed for example.\n\n\nAdjustCameraTargetInfluence(CameraTarget cameraTarget, float targetInfluenceH, float targetInfluenceV, float duration = 0f)\n\n\n\n\nParameters\n:\n\n\n\n\ncameraTarget\n: The CameraTarget of the target\n\n\ntargetInfluenceH\n: The influence this target horizontal position should have when calculating the average position of all the targets\n\n\ntargetInfluenceV\n: The influence this target vertical position should have when calculating the average position of all the targets\n\n\nduration\n: The time it takes for this target to reach it\u2019s influence. Don\u2019t use a duration if calling every frame\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdate Screen Size\n\n\nIf you want to manually adjust at runtime the size of the camera.\n\n\nUpdateScreenSize(float newSize, float duration = 0f)\n\n\n\n\nParameters\n:\n\n\n\n\nnewSize\n: Half of the wanted size in world units\n\n\nduration\n: How long it should take to reach the provided size\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMove Camera Instantly to Position\n\n\nIf you want to manually move the camera.\n\n\nMoveCameraInstantlyToPosition(Vector2 cameraPos)\n\n\n\n\nParameters\n:\n\n\n\n\ncameraPos\n: The final position of the camera\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReset\n\n\nResets the camera movement and size and also all of its extensions to their start values. It\u2019s very useful to use, for example, when your character dies and spawns in a different position on screen.\n\n\nReset(bool centerOnTargets = true, bool resetSize = true, bool resetExtensions = true)\n\n\n\n\nParameters\n:\n\n\n\n\ncenterOnTargets\n: If true (default), the camera will instantly move to your targets position\n\n\nresetSize\n: If true (default), resets the camera size to the start value\n\n\nresetExtensions\n: If true (default), resets all active extensions to their start values\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReset Movement\n\n\nCancels any existing camera movement easing. \n\n\nResetMovement()\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReset Size\n\n\nResets the camera size to the start value.\n\n\nResetSize()\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReset Extensions\n\n\nResets all active extensions to their start values. Notice you can manually reset each extension using the \"OnReset\" method.\n\n\nResetExtensions()\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCenter On Targets\n\n\nInstantly moves the camera to the targets' position.\n\n\nCenterOnTargets()",
